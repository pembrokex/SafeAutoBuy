# SafeAutoBuy

> A privacy-preserving decentralized token purchase platform powered by Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

SafeAutoBuy is an innovative blockchain application that enables users to purchase ERC20 tokens while maintaining complete privacy of their purchase intentions. Built on Ethereum using Zama's FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine), SafeAutoBuy ensures that token addresses and purchase amounts remain encrypted end-to-end, only revealed when the platform owner fulfills the order.

## üåü Overview

SafeAutoBuy transforms the token purchasing experience by introducing privacy-first mechanics into decentralized finance. Users submit encrypted purchase orders specifying which token they want and how much, deposit ETH to fund their purchases, and await fulfillment‚Äîall without revealing their trading intentions to anyone, including miners, validators, or front-runners.

### Key Features

- **üîí Confidential Trading**: Token addresses and amounts are fully encrypted on-chain using FHE
- **üé≤ Fair Order Selection**: Platform owner randomly selects pending orders for processing
- **üí∞ Fixed Price Model**: Predictable, transparent pricing without AMM slippage
- **‚ö° On-Chain Decryption**: Zama Oracle decrypts orders securely for fulfillment
- **üí≥ Flexible Fund Management**: Users deposit/withdraw ETH balances at will
- **üìä Multi-Token Support**: Support for multiple ERC20 tokens with individual pricing
- **üéØ Order Lifecycle Management**: Complete order tracking from submission to fulfillment
- **üõ°Ô∏è MEV Protection**: Encrypted orders prevent front-running and sandwich attacks
- **üîê Privacy-Preserving**: No one knows what you're buying until order fulfillment

## üéØ Problem Solved

Traditional decentralized exchanges and token purchase platforms expose several critical vulnerabilities:

1. **Front-Running**: Miners and bots can observe pending transactions and execute trades before you
2. **Sandwich Attacks**: Malicious actors place orders before and after yours to profit from price movement
3. **MEV Exploitation**: Maximum Extractable Value attacks drain user profits
4. **Privacy Leakage**: All trading intentions are visible on-chain before execution
5. **Price Manipulation**: Large orders can be detected and exploited
6. **Strategic Disadvantage**: Competitors and adversaries can monitor your trading patterns

SafeAutoBuy solves these problems by:

- Encrypting purchase orders completely (token + amount)
- Preventing transaction analysis and pattern detection
- Using random order selection to prevent gaming
- Decrypting only at fulfillment time through trusted Zama Oracle
- Providing fixed prices to eliminate front-running incentives
- Enabling confidential trading strategies for institutions and individuals

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

SafeAutoBuy consists of three main components:

### 1. Smart Contracts (Solidity + FHEVM)

#### **SafeAutoBuy.sol**
The core contract that manages encrypted orders, ETH deposits, and order fulfillment.

**Key Features:**
- Encrypted order submission using `eaddress` and `euint32` types
- ETH balance management (deposit/withdraw)
- Random order selection and decryption request
- Decryption callback for order fulfillment
- Fixed price configuration per token
- Comprehensive order lifecycle tracking (Pending ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Completed/Failed/Canceled)

**Order Flow:**
1. User submits encrypted order with token address and amount
2. ETH is deposited to user's contract balance
3. Owner randomly picks a pending order
4. Contract requests decryption from Zama Oracle
5. Oracle decrypts and calls back with plaintext values
6. Contract validates, deducts ETH, and transfers tokens
7. Order marked as completed or failed with detailed events

#### **TestToken.sol**
ERC20 test token implementation for platform testing and demonstration.

**Features:**
- Standard ERC20 functionality
- Configurable decimals
- Minting and burning capabilities
- Used for TEST and TEST2 demonstration tokens

   - Contract will randomly select a pending order
   - Zama Oracle decrypts the order
   - Contract automatically fulfills if user has sufficient ETH
   - User receives tokens, ETH is deducted

3. **Fund Contract Inventory**
   ```bash
   # Transfer tokens to contract for fulfillment
   # Using Hardhat task:
   npx hardhat transfer-tokens --token <TOKEN_ADDRESS> --to <SAFEAUTOBUY_ADDRESS> --amount <AMOUNT>
   ```

## üéì How It Works

### Encryption Process

1. **User Input**: User selects token and amount in frontend
2. **Client-Side Encryption**: Zama FHE SDK encrypts values locally
3. **Proof Generation**: SDK generates zero-knowledge proof of encryption
4. **Transaction Submission**: Encrypted handles + proof sent to contract
5. **On-Chain Storage**: Contract stores encrypted values as `eaddress` and `euint32`

### Order Processing

1. **Random Selection**: Owner calls `pickRandomAndRequestDecryption()`
2. **Pseudo-Random Algorithm**: Uses `block.prevrandao` + timestamp + count
3. **Decryption Request**: Contract calls Zama Oracle with encrypted values
4. **Oracle Decryption**: Zama Oracle decrypts using secure threshold cryptography
5. **Callback Execution**: Oracle calls `decryptionCallback()` with plaintext values
6. **Signature Verification**: Contract validates oracle signatures
7. **Order Fulfillment**: Contract checks balance, transfers tokens, deducts ETH
8. **Event Emission**: `OrderCompleted` event with order details

### Security Guarantees

- **Confidentiality**: Encrypted values never exposed until decryption
- **Integrity**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure valid encryptions
- **Authenticity**: Oracle signatures verify legitimate decryption
- **Non-Repudiation**: All actions logged with events
- **Access Control**: Owner-only functions protected with Ownable pattern
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Standard OpenZeppelin patterns used
